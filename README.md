# Landing page for The Odin Project

A webpage to practice what I've learnt of HTML, CSS and Flexbox.

## Review

I enjoyed implementing what I've learnt so far in relation to CSS Flex especially. The divs I've used for the layout feels particularly nested and I'm unsure whether there is a cleaner way to go about it. Removing them seems to break the layout, so this is the best I've come up with for now.
